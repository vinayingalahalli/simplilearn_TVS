hello from char demo
no need of conversion in char stream
if you write or read whatever but conversion is not required
char streams will be good if you are planning on UNI_CODE stuff
byte streams are faster than char streams due to byte is low level understood by machine, but char provides unicode support
so think accordingly and choose the appropriate stream.
